**The Sustainable Wardrobe**

Open your closet: it's full of clothes, but you "have nothing to wear". It is the Fast Fashion paradox.

**Cost per Wear**
* A {{CURRENCY}}5 t-shirt you wear twice before it loses shape = {{CURRENCY}}2.50 per wear.
* A {{CURRENCY}}30 quality t-shirt you wear 100 times = {{CURRENCY}}0.30 per wear.
Spending more upfront often means saving in the end.

**The Rule of 30**
Before buying an item, ask yourself: "Will I wear this at least 30 times?". If the answer is no (or "maybe"), put it back. You will save hundreds of {{CURRENCY}} in impulse buys.

**Care for your Clothes**
Wash less and cold. Jeans shouldn't be washed after every use (it ruins them!). Learn to read labels: a wool sweater washed incorrectly becomes a doll's sweater. Making clothes last is the first eco-friendly act.
