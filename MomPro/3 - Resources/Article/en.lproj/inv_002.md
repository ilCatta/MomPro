Have you noticed that your grocery cart costs more and more, even if you buy the same things? That is inflation.

**The "Invisible Thief"**
Inflation is like a tiny thief that sneaks into your bank account every night and scrapes a bit of value off your coins.
If inflation is at 3% per year, your {{CURRENCY}}100 from last year is worth {{CURRENCY}}97 today. It seems small, but over 10 or 20 years, the effect is devastating.

**How to Beat It**
The only shield against inflation is to grow your money faster than prices rise.
* Checking Account: 0% Growth. (You lose to inflation).

We don't invest to become millionaires overnight, but to protect our hard work and savings from this invisible thief.
