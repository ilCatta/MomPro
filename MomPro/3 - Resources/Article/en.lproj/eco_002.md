**Stop Buying Bottled Water**

Bottled water is one of the biggest scams of modern marketing.

**The Numbers**
* Tap water: {{CURRENCY}}0.002 per liter.
* Bottled water: {{CURRENCY}}0.30 per liter.
You are paying **150 times more** for bottled water. It's like paying {{CURRENCY}}150 for a coffee at a bar.

**The Fear of Limescale**
Many moms fear that tap water causes kidney stones. Doctors have debunked this myth: the calcium in water is absorbed by your bones, it doesn't settle in your kidneys (in fact, it prevents osteoporosis!).
If you don't like the taste, use a filter jug or install an under-sink filter (a {{CURRENCY}}50 investment you recover in 2 months).

**The Weight of Plastic**
A family of 4 consumes about 1,500 plastic bottles a year. Imagine carrying all of them up the stairs. Stopping means saving money, effort, and pollution.
