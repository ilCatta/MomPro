Commercial cleaners are expensive ({{CURRENCY}}2-4 per bottle) and often full of irritants. You can clean 90% of your house with 3 ingredients that cost pennies.

**The Starter Kit (Total cost < {{CURRENCY}}5)**
1. **White Vinegar:** Degreaser and limescale remover.
2. **Baking Soda:** Gentle abrasive and odor absorber.
3. **Citric Acid:** The king of fabric softeners and rinse aids (more eco-friendly than vinegar for the washing machine).

**Recipe: All-Purpose Spray**
In an empty spray bottle, mix:
* 20% white vinegar (or citric acid solution).
* 80% water.
* 5 drops of lemon essential oil (for scent).
Use it on glass, kitchen counters, and bathroom fixtures. Cost: about {{CURRENCY}}0.10 per bottle!

**What NEVER to Mix**
Never mix bleach with ammonia or vinegar. It creates very dangerous toxic fumes. Natural remedies are safe when used individually or as per recipe.
