**Stop Emotional Spending**

How many times have you bought something because you were sad, tired, or angry? It's called "Emotional Spending" or Retail Therapy. For a stressed mom, it is a common outlet.

**The HALT Acronym**
Before buying something non-essential, stop (HALT) and ask yourself: am I...
* **H**ungry?
* **A**ngry?
* **L**onely?
* **T**ired?
If the answer is yes, don't buy. Your brain is looking for dopamine, not that object. Have a snack, call a friend, or take a nap. The impulse will pass.

**The 24-Hour Rule**
See a bag or a toy for the kids online? Put it in the cart, but **do not pay**.
Close the site. If after 24 hours (or better 72) you still want it and have the budget, buy it.
90% of the time, the next day you will have forgotten you put it there.

**Calculate cost in HOURS of life**
That item costs {{CURRENCY}}100. You earn {{CURRENCY}}10 an hour.
Is that item worth 10 hours of your work away from your kids? Sometimes the answer is yes, but often it is a powerful "NO".
