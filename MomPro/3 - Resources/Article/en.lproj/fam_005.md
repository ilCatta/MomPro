**Meal Prep for Large Families**

When cooking for 4, 5, or more people, the kitchen becomes a cafeteria. Here, organization isn't optional, it's survival.

**1. The One Meal Rule**
You are not a restaurant. Only one menu is cooked for everyone. Kids will learn to adapt. If someone doesn't like it, the alternative is bread and cheese (or fasting), not a specially cooked meal.

**2. Bulk Cooking**
Don't cook 500g of rice. Cook 2kg.
Cooked rice lasts 3 days in the fridge and transforms:
* Day 1: Hot side dish.
* Day 2: Cold rice salad.
* Day 3: Arancini or stir-fried.
Do the same with potatoes, hard-boiled eggs, and legumes.

**3. Delegate to "Sous-Chefs"**
Kids from age 3 can wash lettuce. From age 6, they can set the table. From age 10, they can cut soft vegetables. Involving them reduces your load and teaches them independence.
