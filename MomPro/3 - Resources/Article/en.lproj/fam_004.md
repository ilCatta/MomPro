**Renovating on a Budget**

Want to refresh your home but have a limited budget? You don't need to knock down walls to change the look.

**1. The Power of Paint**
Paint has the best cost-to-impact ratio. Painting an accent wall, or even old bathroom tiles (with specific enamels), can transform a room for less than {{CURRENCY}}100.

**2. Update Details**
Change kitchen handles, replace faucets, or swap lampshades. These are details the eye notices immediately and make everything look more modern.

**3. Renovate in "Phases"**
Don't do everything at once if you don't have the budget. Start with the room where you spend the most time (usually kitchen or living room). Living in an eternal construction site is stressful: finish one room before starting another.

**Bonus: Tax Deductions**
Before starting big jobs, always check current government bonuses. You can often recover 50% or more of the cost over 10 years.
