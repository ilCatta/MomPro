Batch cooking is the secret weapon of organized moms. It means cooking a lot once, to eat well all week without stress.

**Why does it save money?**
1. You buy family-size packs (lower price per kg).
2. You turn on the oven only once (energy savings).
3. You avoid ordering expensive takeout at the last minute because "there's nothing ready".

**What to cook?**
Not everything freezes well. Focus on:
* Meat sauces and pasta sauces.
* Soups and legume stews.
* Homemade meatballs or burgers.
* Roasted vegetables (they keep for 3-4 days in the fridge).

**The Sunday Ritual**
Dedicate 2 hours on Sunday morning. Put on a podcast or some music. Prepare 3 bases (e.g., rice, roasted chicken, grilled vegetables). During the week, you'll just have to assemble the meals in 5 minutes.
