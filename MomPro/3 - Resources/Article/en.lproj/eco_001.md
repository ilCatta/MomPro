**Starting Zero Waste**

The term "Zero Waste" is scary. It feels like you have to live in a cave with no plastic. In reality, just changing 3 habits can reduce your waste by 50% (and save money).

**1. The best waste is the one that never enters**
Don't focus on how to throw things away. Focus on not letting them into your house.
* Refuse useless gadgets at fairs.
* Say "no thanks" to samples you won't use.
* Don't buy pre-peeled fruit in plastic (it costs three times as much!).

**2. Use what you have**
Don't throw away plastic Tupperware to buy "aesthetic" glass jars from Instagram. That would be a huge waste. Use plastic containers until they break. Zero Waste isn't shopping, it's the opposite of shopping.

**3. Replace disposables**
Calculate: how much do you spend a year on paper towels, cotton pads, and cling film?
* **Paper towels** -> Old washable rags (Free).
* **Cotton pads** -> Washable cotton rounds (Cost {{CURRENCY}}5, last for years).
* **Cling film** -> Silicone lids or a plate on top of the bowl (Free).
