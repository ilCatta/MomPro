**Budgeting for Baby**

The baby marketing industry wants you to believe that to be a good mother, you need expensive gadgets. Spoiler: your baby only needs your love (and clean diapers).

**1. Needs vs. Wants**
A newborn needs: a safe place to sleep, food, warm clothes, and a safe car seat.
They do not need: wipe warmers, designer diaper pails, or shoes (they don't walk!). Cut the fluff.

**2. The "Brand New" Trap**
Cribs, changing tables, and strollers are used for only a few months. Buying these items second-hand will save you up to 70%. They are often like new because they are barely used. Invest the saved money in their future or quality food.

**3. Diapers and Hygiene**
Consider cloth diapers (huge long-term savings + eco-friendly) or look for bulk deals online. For hygiene, warm water and almond oil are often better than a thousand expensive scented creams.
