**Tracking Every Penny**

You can't manage what you don't measure. Many families think they know where their money goes, but underestimate variable expenses by 30%.

**The "Black Hole" of small expenses**
Coffee at the bar, snacks, parking, app store, that "little {{CURRENCY}}5 item" on Amazon.
Individually they are invisible. Together they can be worth {{CURRENCY}}200-300 a month. It's a plane ticket thrown away without realizing it.

**The 30-Day Challenge**
You don't have to live obsessed with accounts forever. Do a challenge:
For just one month, track **everything**. Even the 50 cents.
Use an app, an Excel file, or a notebook.
At the end of the month, sum everything up by category.

**The Revelation**
You will discover uncomfortable truths: "I spend {{CURRENCY}}150 on breakfasts out?!".
That awareness is power. Once you see the number, you can no longer ignore it. From then on, you can consciously choose if that coffee is worth it or if you prefer that money for your Emergency Fund.
