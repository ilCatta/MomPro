**Bulk Shopping Guide**

Buying in bulk (package-free) seems like a hipster thing, but it's how our grandmothers shopped to save money.

**What to buy in bulk?**
* **Dry legumes:** They cost half as much as canned ones. (Remember to soak them the night before!).
* **Refill detergents:** Reuse your old bottle. Save the cost of plastic (which is about 20% of the product price).
* **Fruits and vegetables:** Don't use paid plastic bags. Use your own reusable mesh bags.

**Watch the Prices**
In chic "Organic/Bulk" stores, prices can be high. Always check the price per Kg. Often, however, the savings are in **not wasting**: if you only need 50g of spices for a recipe, why buy a whole jar that will expire? Buy only what you need.
