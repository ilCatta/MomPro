**Save on Utility Bills**

Money often leaks out of our homes without us noticing. Here are 3 immediate changes you'll see on your next bill.

**1. Wash at 30°C**
90% of a washing machine's energy goes into heating the water. Modern detergents are effective at low temperatures. Washing at 30° or 40° instead of 60° cuts the cost per cycle in half. Only run full loads!

**2. Energy Vampires**
The TV, computer, coffee machine: if they have a little red light on (standby), they are consuming power. They account for about 10% of your annual electric bill. Use a power strip with a switch and turn everything off with one click before bed.

**3. The Magic Lid**
It seems trivial, but boiling pasta water without a lid wastes 4 times the energy. Always put the lid on. Also, turn off the heat 2 minutes before the cooking time is up: the pasta will finish cooking with the residual heat (passive cooking).
