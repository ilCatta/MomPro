**The 50/30/20 Rule**

Managing your paycheck shouldn't require a degree in economics. US Senator Elizabeth Warren popularized this rule for its disarming simplicity.

**How to split your net income:**

**50% - Needs**
These are vital expenses: rent/mortgage, utilities, basic groceries, transport, insurance.
*Goal:* Try to fit everything into half your paycheck. If you exceed 50%, you need to cut fixed costs (e.g., car too expensive or house too big).

**30% - Wants**
Here is where many fail: eliminating all fun. If you don't allow yourself enjoyment, the budget will fail.
Dining out, TV subscriptions, clothes, hairdresser, hobbies.
*Tip:* This is the flexible category. If there is an unexpected expense, you cut here.

**20% - Savings**
Do not touch this. As soon as the paycheck arrives, 20% must disappear from the main account.
Used for: Emergency fund, investments, paying off debt.

**Practical Example:**
On €2,000 net:
* €1,000 for home and life.
* €600 to enjoy life.
* €400 for your future.
