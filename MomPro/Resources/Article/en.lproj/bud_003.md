**The Kakebo Method**

*Kakebo* (pronounced "kah-keh-boh") is the Japanese art of saving money. Invented in 1904 by Japan's first female journalist, Motoko Hani, it was designed for housewives managing household finances.

**Why does it work?**
Unlike apps, Kakebo requires you to **write by hand**. This slows down the process and forces the brain to truly process the information. Writing "€50 Restaurant" hurts more than seeing it on a screen, making you more aware.

**The Evening Ritual**
It's not just accounting, it's mindfulness. Every evening (or week), you sit down and answer 4 questions:
1. How much money do I have available?
2. How much would I like to save?
3. How much am I spending?
4. **How can I improve?**

**The Final Reflection**
At the end of the month, Kakebo doesn't just give you a total. It asks: "How did you spend your money? Are you happy with these expenses?".
If you spent too much on clothes but are happy, that's fine. If you spent too much on junk food and feel guilty, next month you will change.
