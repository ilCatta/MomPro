**Dollar Cost Averaging**

The biggest fear? "What if I invest today and the market crashes tomorrow?". The solution is called **DCA** (Dollar Cost Averaging), or an Automatic Investment Plan.

**What is it?**
Instead of investing €5,000 all at once, you invest €100 a month, automatically, forever.
It's like a Netflix subscription, but instead of watching shows, you're buying pieces of your future.

**Why does it work for moms?**
1. **No Anxiety:** You don't need to watch the news or charts. The purchase is automatic.
2. **Buy the Dip:** If the market crashes, your €100 buys more shares at a discount. When the market recovers, those shares will be worth much more.
3. **Habit:** It becomes a "positive" bill you pay to yourself before spending the rest.

Set up the automatic transfer and forget about it. In 10 years, you will thank yourself.
