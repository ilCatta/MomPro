**Low Cost Family Holidays**

Traveling with kids doesn't have to drain your bank account. Memories are made with experiences, not hotel stars.

**1. Home Swapping**
Platforms like HomeExchange allow you to swap your home with another family's. Accommodation cost? Zero. Plus, you'll have a real kitchen to avoid eating out for every meal.

**2. Staycation: Tourists in your own city**
Sometimes you don't need to go far. Grab a map of your region and visit parks, lakes, or museums you've always ignored. Pack picnic lunches and turn the trip into an adventure. Cost: gas and sandwiches.

**3. Travel "Off-Season"**
If your kids are small and not yet in school, avoid August like the plague. September or June cost half as much, and the weather is better.
