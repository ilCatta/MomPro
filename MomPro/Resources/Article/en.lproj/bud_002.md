**The Emergency Fund**

The Emergency Fund is the difference between a "minor inconvenience" and a "financial disaster". It is your parachute.

**What is it?**
It is a sum of money separate from the checking account you use for groceries, intended **exclusively** for real emergencies.
* ✅ Yes: Boiler breaks, job loss, medical urgency.
* ❌ No: Christmas gifts, vacations, sales, changing cars because you want a new one.

**How big should it be?**
The golden rule is: **3 to 6 months of essential expenses**.
If you spend €1,500 a month to live (rent + food + bills), your fund must be between €4,500 and €9,000.
If you are a freelancer or have an unstable job, aim for 6-12 months.

**Where to keep it?**
Not under the mattress (inflation and theft). Not invested in stocks (too risky).
Keep it in an **accessible Savings Account**. It yields little, but the money is safe and you can withdraw it in 24 hours if needed.

**How to build it?**
Start with the first goal: €1,000. Sell old things, work extra hours, cut "Wants". Once you reach €1,000, you will feel immediate peace of mind.
