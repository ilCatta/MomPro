**Recycling isn't enough**

We were taught that if we throw plastic in the recycling bin, we "saved the planet". Unfortunately, it's not that simple.

**The Recycling Myth**
Only 9% of the plastic ever produced has actually been recycled. The rest is still there, in landfills or the ocean. Recycling plastic consumes a lot of energy and often turns into lower quality items (downcycling).

**The Hierarchy (The 5 Rs)**
1. **Refuse:** Say no to what you don't need.
2. **Reduce:** Use fewer resources.
3. **Reuse:** Use glass jars for preserves, use old clothes as rags.
4. **Recycle:** Only when you can't do the first three.
5. **Rot (Compost):** Food scraps are precious. If you have a garden or balcony, consider a home composter: you'll reduce your trash by 30% and get free soil for your plants!
