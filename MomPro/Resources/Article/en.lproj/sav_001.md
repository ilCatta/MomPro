**Supermarket Hacks**

Did you know supermarkets are designed by marketing experts to make you spend about 20% more than planned? Here is how to defend your wallet.

**1. Look Down**
The most expensive items and famous brands are placed at "eye level" (or kid-level for sweets!). If you look at the bottom shelves, you will often find generic or "white label" products with the same ingredients at half the price.

**2. The Perimeter Rule**
Fresh, healthy foods (fruits, vegetables, meat, dairy) are usually arranged along the outer perimeter of the store. The central aisles are full of processed and expensive foods. Stick to the edges!

**3. Don't Touch Everything!**
Behavioral studies show that if you touch a product, the likelihood of buying it increases by 40% because your brain already feels a sense of "ownership". Keep your hands on the cart.

**4. The List is Law**
Never enter without a list. If an item is not on the list, it doesn't exist (unless it's a true emergency). This eliminates impulse buying, which is the number one enemy of savings.
