**Teaching Kids About Money**

Financial education starts at home, long before school. Here is how to raise money-conscious kids.

**1. Educational Allowance**
Give a small weekly amount, but don't tie it to basic chores (like making the bed, which is everyone's duty). Tie it to management: if they spend all the money on candy by Monday, they have to wait until next week. They will learn patience and budgeting.

**2. The 3 Jars**
Instead of just one piggy bank, use three:
* **Spend:** For small immediate wants.
* **Save:** For a bigger goal (e.g., a video game).
* **Give:** To help those with less (develops empathy).

**3. Talk Openly**
Don't say "we have no money." Say "we chose to use our money for something else (e.g., vacation) instead of this toy." Teach priorities, not scarcity.
