**Compound Interest Magic**

Albert Einstein called it "the eighth wonder of the world". It's the reason why starting early changes everything.

**The Snowball Effect**
Imagine a snowball rolling down a mountain.
At first, it's small. But as it rolls, it collects more snow. The collected snow then collects even more snow. After a while, the ball becomes a huge avalanche.

**How it works with money**
You invest €100 and earn €10 in interest. Now you have €110.
The next year, you earn interest not only on your initial €100, but also on the €10 you already earned!

**Real Example**
* Mom A starts at 25, invests for 10 years, then stops.
* Mom B starts at 35 and invests for 30 years.
Incredibly, Mom A might end up with more money, despite putting in much less, simply because her snowball has been rolling for longer.
