**Buying Second Hand**

For children, "brand new" is a huge waste. They grow so fast that clothes or toys are barely used. Let's change our mindset.

**The "Hard" vs "Soft" Rule**
* **Buy Used:** Anything "hard" (plastic, wood, metal) can be cleaned and sterilized perfectly. High chairs, bikes, Legos, cribs. Savings: up to 70%.
* **Check Carefully:** Fabrics, mattresses, or shoes (which mold to the foot). Be more careful here, but you can often find "new with tags" items on apps like Vinted.

**Sell What You Don't Use**
Decluttering makes you money. Don't keep clothes "for the next baby" if it will be 4 years: elastic bands dry out and trends change. Sell immediately while it still has value. That €50 earned is your budget for the next purchase.

**Safety First**
For car seats, be careful: if they have been in an accident, they are not safe. In this specific case, if you don't know the history, buying new or from trusted friends is better.
