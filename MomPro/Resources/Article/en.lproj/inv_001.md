**Why Invest Now?**

Many moms think investing is just for "rich people" or Wall Street wolves. The truth? **Not investing is the biggest risk you can take.**

**The Risk of Doing Nothing**
Imagine hiding €10,000 under your mattress today. In 20 years, that money will still be there, but it will buy half as much stuff. This is because the cost of living always goes up. Leaving money sitting in a checking account means choosing to slowly become poorer.

**Time is Your Ally**
You don't need to wait until you have "lots of money". You need to start **now**, even with €50 a month. The sooner you start, the less effort it takes.

**For Your Kids**
Investing isn't speculating on the stock market hoping to strike it rich. It's planting a tree today so your children can sit in its shade in 15 years (maybe to pay for college).
