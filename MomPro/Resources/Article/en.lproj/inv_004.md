**ETFs vs Single Stocks**

Imagine you have to buy fruit.
* **Single Stock:** You buy only apples. If apples rot or get a virus that year, you have nothing to eat.
* **ETF (Exchange Traded Fund):** You buy a giant fruit salad ready-made with apples, pears, bananas, grapes, and strawberries from all over the world.

**Why choose ETFs?**
ETFs are "baskets" containing thousands of different companies.
By buying just 1 share of a Global ETF (costing around €80-100), you automatically become a shareholder in Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, but also companies in Japan, Europe, and Australia.

If one company fails (the apples rot), the thousands of others compensate.
For a mom who has no time to analyze balance sheets, ETFs are the safest and most efficient tool to invest in the global market.
